## Introduction

Let's play High Card! It's an exciting game of luck, skill, and... actually, no, just luck.

High card works such that two players are dealt a card, and the player with the higher card wins.

e.g.

```js
Player 1 is showing the 2 of Hearts
Player 2 is showing the J of Hearts
Player 2 wins!
```
